🛡️ License Sentinel Pro: Enterprise Billing AutomationLicense Sentinel Pro is a dual-engine solution designed to manage software licenses and automate billing reminders. It consists of a Streamlit Dashboard for manual management and a Background Engine for automated "Auto-Pilot" notifications.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe system operates using a "Shared-File" architecture:App Engine (app.py): The user interface where Excel files are uploaded and credentials are saved. It writes to data.xlsx and config.json.Automation Engine (scheduler.py): A background service that reads the shared files and executes notifications based on the defined billing frequency.🚀 Getting Started1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Install the required libraries:Bashpip install streamlit pandas openpyxl requests schedule
2. Launching the SuiteDouble-click the launch_sentinel.bat file. This will open:Terminal 1: The Dashboard (Access via http://localhost:8501)Terminal 2: The Automation Engine (Scanning for triggers every 10 seconds in Test Mode)⚙️ Configuration & Data SetupThe Settings TabBefore automation will work, go to the Settings tab in the Dashboard and enter:Sender Gmail: Your corporate Gmail address.App Password: A 16-digit Google App Password (not your regular password).Telegram Bot Token: Obtained from @BotFather.Telegram Chat ID: The ID of the group or admin receiving alerts.Required Excel SchemaThe system expects an .xlsx file with the following columns (case-sensitive):Column NameDescriptionEndCustomerNameThe name of the client.StatusMust be ACTIVE for notifications to trigger.Subscription periodThe contract duration (e.g., Annually, Monthly).Billing periodThe Trigger: Set to Daily, Monthly, or Annually.Renewal dateThe date used to calculate monthly/annual triggers.Quantity & AmountUsed to calculate the Total Due ($Qty \times Amt$).Client ContactThe email address where the invoice reminder is sent.🤖 Automation LogicThe Automation Engine follows these rules for ACTIVE licenses:Daily: Sends a notification every time the engine runs.Monthly: Sends a notification once a month on the day matching the Renewal date.Annually: Sends a notification once a year on the exact Renewal date.Note: The engine checks the Expiration date. If the current date is past the expiration, notifications stop automatically, even if the status is still marked "Active."🛠️ Maintenance & ProductionTo move from Testing to Production:Open scheduler.py.Locate the # SCHEDULER INITIALIZATION section.Comment out the 10.seconds line and uncomment the .day.at("09:00") line.Python# Production Mode
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(check_and_send_reminders)
